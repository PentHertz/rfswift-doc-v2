## RF Swift vs. Specific Security or RF distributions comparison

Your hearth struggle choosing a specific distribution and RF Swift? Here are some key arguments that at the end made us developped that solution ;)

With RF Swift's container-based architecture, each engagement runs in its own isolated environment. You can experiment freely, knowing that a broken dependency or conflicting library won't cascade across your entire system.

| Feature | RF Swift | Pentest Distributions | Dragon OS |
|---------|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| 🖥️ **Host OS Preservation** | ✅ Runs alongside your existing OS | ❌ Requires dedicated partition or VM | ❌ Requires dedicated partition or VM |
| 🧰 **Tool Isolation** | ✅ Tools run in containers without impacting system | ⚠️ Tools can affect system stability | ⚠️ Tools can affect system stability |
| 🚀 **Deployment Speed** | ✅ Fast container deployment | ❌ Full OS installation required | ❌ Full OS installation required |
| 📦 **VM Requirement** | ✅ No VM needed | ⚠️ Needs VM for non-dedicated machines | ⚠️ Needs VM for non-dedicated machines |
