## Why Container Scripts?

Container scripts extend RF Swift's capabilities by:

1. **Simplifying Complex Tasks**: Turn multi-step processes into single commands
2. **Enhancing Device Compatibility**: Improve functionality with specialized hardware
3. **Maintaining Updates**: Keep tools and utilities current with minimal effort
4. **Enabling Advanced Features**: Access capabilities not available in standard configurations

## Using Container Scripts

All container scripts are automatically installed in RF Swift containers and available in the system PATH. You can execute them directly from any directory inside the container:

```bash
# Example: Start Avahi service discovery
avahicontainer_start

# Example: Update RF scripts
update_rfscripts

# Example: Swap USRP firmware
libresdr_swapfpga
```

## Script Categories

### Service Enablement
Scripts that activate or configure services inside containers:
- **[Avahi Container Script](avahi_inside_container)**: Enables mDNS service discovery

### Hardware Enhancement
Scripts that modify or optimize hardware functionality:
- **[LibreSDR Firmware Swap](libresdr_swap_firmware)**: Enhances USRP devices with improved firmware

### Maintenance
Scripts that help keep your environment updated and optimized:
- **[RF Scripts Updater](rfswift_install)**: Synchronizes local scripts with the latest versions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with container scripts:

- Ensure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x scriptname`)
- Check that required dependencies are installed in the container
- Verify you have the necessary permissions for the operation
- Consult the specific script documentation for troubleshooting guidance
