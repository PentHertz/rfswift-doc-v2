# RF Swift Development Guide

This section covers topics related to developing with RF Swift, building custom components, and contributing to the project. Whether you want to compile the RF Swift binary from source, create custom container images, or extend the project's capabilities, you'll find the necessary guidance here.

## Getting Started with Development

RF Swift is designed to be extensible and customizable. You can tailor it to your specific RF assessment needs by:

1. **Compiling the binary** from source with custom features or for specific architectures
2. **Building custom container images** with specialized tools
3. **Contributing to the core project** by adding new features or fixing issues

## Development Environment Setup

Before diving into RF Swift development, ensure your environment meets these prerequisites:

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.20+**: Required for compiling the RF Swift binary
- **Docker**: Required for building and testing container images
- **BuildX**: Required for cross-platform image building
- **Git**: Required for source code management

## Cross-Platform Development

RF Swift supports multiple platforms and architectures. When developing:

- Test on multiple operating systems when possible
- Use BuildX for cross-platform container builds
- Consider architecture-specific optimizations for ARM64 and RISC-V

## Community Resources
