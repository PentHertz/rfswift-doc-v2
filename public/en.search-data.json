This rfswift is the main program you will interact with to run clean containers, execute inside running or paused containers, and do many magic actions that will make things work without headache. Docker images - some pre-built Docker container images are available in RF Swift’s repository. In case you wan to bake your own environment, preserve some spaces, and have a special set-up, you will also find some Docker files you can edit to fit your expectations. ","what-is-rf-swift#What is RF Swift?":"RF Swift is a toolbox for creating an environment laboratory for your RF assessments, that can easily fit your prerequirements.\nThis toolbox is probably the best solution to deploy a generic, as well as a special environment securely, skipping the headache and waste of time when installing and using RF tools on same host.\n⚠️ Even if the project, could work on macOS with some manual workaround, we do not adverstise it for the moment, but this system will be a 100% supported anytime soon.
