To install RF Swift, you can either use pre-compiled binaries and existing container images (quickest method) or compile the Go project and/or Docker images from source. This guide focuses on the fastest way to get up and running.\nInstall RF Swift Linux and macOS The easiest way to install RF Swift on Linux or macOS is to use the installation script:\n# Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/PentHertz/RF-Swift.git cd RF-Swift # Run the installation script ./install.sh The install.sh script will:\nInstall all required dependencies (Docker, BuildX, Go) Configure necessary services (xhost, PulseAudio) Set up proper permissions Create a system-wide alias for the rfswift command Install the latest RF Swift binary Windows or Manual Installation If you prefer manual installation or are using Windows:\nDownload the latest binary from the official repository ↗ Rename the binary to rfswift (or rfswift.exe on Windows) Make the binary executable (on Linux/macOS): chmod +x rfswift When you run the binary for the first time, it will guide you through configuration:\nrfswift Config file not found. Would you like to create one with default values? (y/n) Select y to create a default configuration file or n to configure manually.\nPull a Pre-built Image RF Swift provides several pre-built images to get you started quickly.

Run the Container Once you have an image, you can create and run a container:\nrfswift run -i sdr_full -n my_sdr_container This will start a container using the sdr_full image with the name my_sdr_container.\nRun Command Options:\nrfswift run -i sdr_full -n my_sdr_container The run command has numerous options for configuring your container environment:\nFlag Description -i, --image string Image name/tag to use (default: ‘myrfswift:latest’) -n, --name string Name for the container (makes it easier to reference later) -b, --bind string Extra bind mounts, separated by commas (e.g., /host/path:/container/path,/another/path:/in/container) -s, --devices string Extra device mappings in unprivileged mode, separated by commas (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0) -a, --capabilities string Extra Linux capabilities, separated by commas (e.g., NET_ADMIN,SYS_ADMIN) -t, --network string Network mode (default: ‘host’) -u, --privileged int Set privilege level (1: privileged, 0: unprivileged) -e, --command string Command to execute (default: ‘/bin/bash’) -d, --display string Set X Display (duplicates host’s env by default) (default “DISPLAY=:0”) -p, --pulseserver string PulseAudio server TCP address (default: “tcp:127.0.0.1:34567”) -w, --bindedports string Ports to bind (between container and host) -z, --exposedports string Ports to expose -x, --extrahosts string Set extra hosts (default: ‘pluto.local:192.168.1.2’), separated by commas -g, --cgroups string Extra cgroup rules, separated by commas -m, --seccomp string Set Seccomp profile (default: ‘default’) Share Files with the Container:\nTo share files between your host system and the container:\nrfswift run -i sdr_full -n my_sdr_container -b ~/sdr_projects:/home/user/projects You can bind multiple directories by separating them with commas:\nrfswift run -i sdr_full -n my_sdr_container -b ~/sdr_projects:/home/user/projects,~/datasets:/home/user/data Share Specific Devices:\nWhen running in unprivileged mode, you can share specific devices:\nrfswift run -i sdr_full -n my_sdr_container -s /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 Multiple devices can be shared by separating them with commas:\nrfswift run -i sdr_full -n my_sdr_container -s /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0,/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 Add Linux Capabilities:\nFor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tools, you may need additional Linux capabilities:\nrfswift run -i wifi_tools -n my_wifi_container -a NET_ADMIN For multiple capabilities:\nrfswift run -i advanced_tools -n my_container -a NET_ADMIN,SYS_ADMIN ⚠️ Security Consideration: Be cautious when adding capabilities like NET_ADMIN.
